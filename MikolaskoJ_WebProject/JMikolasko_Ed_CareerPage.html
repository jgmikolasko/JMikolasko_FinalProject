		As mentioned earlier, I am currently going through <a href="https://waketech.edu/">Wake Technical Community College</a>, working towards an Associates degree in<br/><br/> 
		"Information Technology, Cybersecurity". I don't know very much about the subject yet, but I have heard it's a growing field for new workers.<br/><br/>
		I plan on continuing my education at <a href="https://uncw.edu/">University of North Carolina, Wilmington</a> where I will finish my Bachelors degree.<br/><br/>
		In reality, I'm working towards this degree in an effort to join the Navy while qualifying to train for an Officer position. The job I have aspired<br/><br/>
		to join for the past 4 years now is a <a href="https://www.navy.com/seals">Navy Seal</a>. When I first considered the opportunity, I planned on joining as an Enlisted soldier straight out of<br/><br/>
		high school, however I never seemed to realize the scale of difficulty I was trying to overcome, so I waited. I gave less effort in classes<br/><br/>
		and focused more on my physical capability. While this is an important factor to even qualify for the training, I failed to realize the opportunity<br/><br/>
		I had to become better than the average enlisted. The schooling I had access to could give me a window towards something even better<br/><br/>
		than my original "life plan". The strangest part about this realization was that I believed, and still believe, I could succeed.<br/><br/>
		I have not felt this passionate or confident about a goal like this before, so I am currently in the scratch, turning this pipe dream into a reality.

		I feel the career I'm working towards can also fuel my love for beaches, travel, and the ocean. I found a majority of my photos handle scenes<br/><br/>
		from the coast, and the biggest part of my dream career takes me straight to the sand, so I look forward to my nearing future.<br/><br/>
		I am also trying to wrap my head around the suffering in store for me. This suffering will not be the cause of a regression though, but rather growth.<br/><br/>
		I want to work harder than I ever have before, both physically and mentally, and to do this I need to "suffer". I know it will be the only effective way<br/><br/>
		for me to grow, and it will be difficult but I look forward to the challenges ahead.
