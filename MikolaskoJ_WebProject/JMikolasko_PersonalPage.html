	<p1><center>Hello! My name is Jonathan. At the time creating this site, I'm 19 years old, currently working my way through an associates degree.<br/><br/>
    My hobbies include photography, travel, hiking, running, and lots of art. I probabaly enjoy too many forms of art, though I don't endulge<br/><br/>
	much in the creations myself. I love trying to interpret the messages behind a work and noticing the fine details that most glances wouldn't notice.<br/>

	<p2><center>Above, I attached two examples of photographs I have taken in the past! Aside from sketching or drawing, photography is my next favorite form of art.<br/><br/>
	The first example on the left was captured in Drakes Bay, California. I remember it being a popular spot to visit for all the seals on the beach.<br/><br/>
	The second example shown on the right was taken at Falls Lake, North Carolina. I have not been in North Carolina very long,<br/><br/> 
	so I don't have many pictures from here yet, however I'm planning to take advantage of my free time over the summers to try and find new places to <br/><br/>
	explore. Originally, I'm from California but I moved to North Carolina in the summer of 2022. Being here for almost a year now has pretty much<br/><br/>
	created a "new life" for me, but it has helped me become a better student and person in general, so you won't hear me complaining!
